  description: >
    Create a static resume website from `resume_text`, applying the content outline,
    visual direction, and accessibility guidance. Return HTML, CSS, and JS that renders a clean,
    modern, and readable resume website. Use semantic HTML, strong typography, and responsive
    layout. Use minimal, purposeful JavaScript only (no frameworks). Fonts may be loaded from
    Google Fonts. Ensure the layout is GitHub Pages-friendly (plain HTML + CSS + JS). Enforce
    contrast, focus states, and mobile-first layout. Do not include placeholder text.
    Use ONLY facts from `resume_text` and do not invent content. Do not add new skills, companies,
    dates, titles, metrics, or projects not present in `resume_text`. If data is missing, omit the
    section or leave it blank. You may reformat or reorder but must preserve factual content.
    Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not wrap in markdown or add commentary.
